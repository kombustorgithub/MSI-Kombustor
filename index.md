The MSI Kombustor utility is a popular benchmarking tool for graphics card manufacturers and enthusiasts. The MSI company has developed the software to test high-end graphics cards’ stability and thermal performance.

This application is based on the well-known Furmark tool, which tests the stability and thermal performance of graphics cards.

The main purpose of this application is to push your GPU to its limits and test its stability in an extreme environment with extreme loads.

The MSI Kombustor utility can be used to test the stability and thermal performance of high-end graphics cards by stressing them with high-frequency thermal cycles so that they can be compared with one another or with other products on the market.

## How Does MSI Kombustor work?
The MSI Kombustor utility works by running a series of tests on the graphics card in order to push it to its limits. These tests include:

– A Furmark stress test, which puts a heavy load on the GPU and stresses it to its limits.

– A thermal cycle test, which subjects the GPU to high and low temperatures in order to test its thermal performance.

– A stability test, which runs the graphics card through a series of demanding tasks in order to test its stability.

MSI Kombustor is a valuable tool for anyone who is looking to purchase a new graphics card or wants to compare the performance of different models. It is also useful for graphics card manufacturers who want to test the stability and thermal performance of their products.
